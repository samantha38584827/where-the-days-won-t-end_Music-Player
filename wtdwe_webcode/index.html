                    \ncall me back when you can
                    \nYou had me tangled in your charmsTalking ‘bout nothingBut now those times feel fragile,I'm trying not to try so hard
                    \nCan we find the same old magic?Or is it lost, forever tragic?
                    \nIn that summer when we were closeYou told me that it would stayYour heart feels so distantLike I'm here and you're not there
                    \nWill you ever lemme know?Even just pretending?
                    \nBack in that summer when we’re close,You told me that it would stayI'd rather have you here,Yet somehow, I can't heal.Oooohh oooh
                    \nEvery minute you said that we’d make fine,But time has slipped through our hands.`,

                \nMaybe it was Shiraz; we weren’t sober

                \nThe mark on my neck stayed like bruise
                \nThe way you looked at me, it felt familiar
                            
                \nI remember I had tears in eyes
                \nTelling you how I feared goodbyes
                \nYou felt like marigolds in sway
                \nDriving out the gloom

                \nOh, we danced when we were together
                \nThe scent still hangs on my sweater 
                \nThat aroma on my wrists

                \nIt’s the little things that make me feel

                \nTonight’s the time to cross that line

                \nYou asked me,”why don’t you ever look me in the eye?”

                \nShe has her necklace tied together 
                \nendless like you & me forever

                \nShe shimmers in the night, oh

                \n(She shimmers in the night)

                \nI wanna be the one you hold
                \nAnd run to you like a little kid
                \nI still remember when I first knew
                \nWhen I fell in love way back then 

                \nWe shimmer in the night oh yeah 

                \nWe shimmer in the night

                \nLaughing about nothing.

                \nYou leaned in close and whispered,
                \nAt around 11, close, my dear.

                \nDo you remember it all now?
                \nBack then, it felt like sand in an hourglass.

                \nAnd I think about all we could’ve been,
                \nWhile you’re somewhere far away 

                \nAs I picture us slowly passing by,
                \nShimmering in June.

                \nIt’s so hard to forget this,
                \nBut I can still feel your touch through my hair, babe.

                \nWe were meant to live all of this ,
